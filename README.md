# Pathfinder 2e - Unchained Sheet
A custom Pathfinder Second Edition character sheet for Roll20.

I built this sheet for my Twitch show, Third Action (www.twitch.tv/thirdcation). The primary purpose was initially to build a sheet that includes health bars (to easily track HP on the stream), but... I kinda' got carried away. Now my goal is to make it into a decent alternative for people who want a slightly different user experience than what the default Roll20 sheet offers. :)

Pathfinder 2E only just came out for real, and I'm still slowly working through updating the sheet to match the new rules. As such, there are probably lots of random small things that are broken. Feel free to make pull requests or note bugs or feature suggestions--I'll try to make improvements as quickly as I can. :)

NOTE 1: This sheet is NOT compatible with the default Roll20 one. If you switch your game to this, you'll probably need to remake any characters from scratch.

NOTE 2: If something's not looking quite right, try toggling buttons on and off or deleting and re-entering a related value. Some of the default values are currently not being set properly, and it can take a toggle to get the sheet to realize what happened.

# Installation Instructions

To add the character sheet to Roll20, you must be a paid subscriber.

* Open your campaign's details page.
* Go to Settings > Game Settings
* Under "Character Sheet Template", select "Custom"
* Copy unchained.html into the HTML layout tab.
* Copy unchained.css into the CSS Styling tab.
* Hit "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page.
* That's it!

If you ever want to update to the latest version of the sheet, just repeat these steps using the latest code on GitHub.

Maybe some day I'll look up how to submit the sheet to Roll20 as a proper community sheet...
